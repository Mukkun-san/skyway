                <strong>1. How to Book </strong>
                <br />
                After choosing your holiday and reading the booking conditions
                please complete the booking form and send it to us along with
                the appropriate non-refundable deposit.
                <br />
                <br />
                Skywaytour.com will send you a booking acceptance letter / mail
                within 5 days of receiving the booking. When you place your
                order with us, it is deemed that you accept our booking
                conditions.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>2. Deposit for Tailor-made holidays </strong>
                <br />
                Deposit payable when placing your order is Rs.20,000/- per
                person. A higher deposit may be payable if booking a luxury
                train or high end tour. Some hotels, including beach resorts,
                wildlife lodges and even city hotels during peak season require
                full payment immediately on booking. In such cases a higher
                deposit may be required. We will advise you of these higher
                deposits, if required, while accepting your booking or soon
                after that as many resorts advise us of their advance
                requirements only after a booking has been made with them.
                Please note the deposit amount is non-refundable, except in
                instances when we cancel the holiday or express our inability to
                confirm your booking.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>3. Insurance </strong>
                <br />
                It is a condition of your booking with us that you have adequate
                travel insurance or provide us with an indemnity.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>4. Confirmation and Final Payment </strong>
                <br />
                On receipt of the booking form and deposit if the holiday
                requested is available, we will send you a Booking Acceptance
                Letter, normally within 7 days. The balance amount due must be
                paid no later than 2 months before departure otherwise we
                reserve the right to treat your booking as cancelled and retain
                the deposit. If the booking is made within 2 months of
                departure, then the full cost of the holiday is payable at the
                time of booking.
                <br />
                <br />
                We do our best to confirm all the arrangements within 7 days
                receiving the order, in some instances changes may be required
                or some confirmations may have to wait till much later. If we
                need to make a significant change to the itinerary booked, such
                as a change of hotel or mode of transport or omission of a
                place, it is done with your concurrence. It is thus important
                that you give us your contact telephone numbers, both for
                daytime and evenings, so that changes to your itinerary, if any,
                can be discussed. For minor variations in the itinerary we do
                not make supplementary charges nor do we offer reductions. If
                however the cost variation exceeds 5% of the total holiday
                price, you may be required to pay the difference, if the costs
                go up, or become entitled to a refund, if the costs go down.
                <br />
                <br />
                We expect you to mention any critical elements, viz., particular
                hotels, resorts, etc., at the time of processing the booking
                itself, changes cannot be made after the booking is processed
                and confirm. In instances where you have not specified any
                critical elements, if the very nature of the holiday changes due
                to non-availability of significant portion(s) of the tour, we
                will ourselves offer you the option of a later departure or
                cancellation with full refund.

                to any surcharges. This guarantee is applicable once we have

                It may be noted that price variations due to changes in
                itinerary are not surcharges and are not governed by this
                guarantee. Surcharge, as defined, is only attributable to
                variation in costs of existing elements of the itinerary.

                </strong>
                <br />
                We reserve the right to cancel a holiday on offer by us,
                including tailor-made holidays, without assigning reasons at any

                        service, technical problems with transportation, civil
                        disorder or the threat of such, riots, strikes, natural
                        disasters, accident or pollution, terrorist activity or
                        the threat of such, war or the threat of war, etc. In
                        deciding whether it is safe to visit a certain
                        destination or not, we depend on the advice of the each
                        Govt. bodies. In such instances we may offer comparable

                        private itinerary. In such instances we may offer
                        comparable alternative arrangements or at your option
                        make a full refund of all monies paid except in cases
                        where the booking is made within 2 months of departure.
                        In the unlikely event of us cancelling a holiday within

                <br />
                We will make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the
                booked tour arrangements but cannot rule out occasional minor
                changes. If the changes are significant we will inform you of
                these before departure, if possible, and offer you comparable
                alternative arrangementsor at your option make a full refund of

                change of airport for international flights to and from your
                holiday destination, the outward or return journey being
                rescheduled by more than twelve hours or the omission of a
                featured overnight stop in the itinerary. Where such changes
                take place for reasons within our control we will offer you a
                compensation of Rs.2,500/- per person if you had paid the full
                holiday price by the prescribed date.
                <br />
                <br />
                Where the change is due to circumstances beyond our control
                amounting to force majeure, such as weather conditions,
                technical problems, civil disorder, decisions by governments or
                other associations, etc., we will offer comparable alternative
                arrangements or if you choose refund fully the monies paid by
                you. If any of the circumstances amounting to force majeure
                occurs during a tour we reserve the right to alter the tour
                programme, as required depending upon the circumstance, without
                offering any compensation. We may consider a refund for the
                unutilised portion of the tour if we are able to obtain any.
                <br />
                <br />
                We reserve the right to cancel your holiday anytime during its
                operation if you are found to be behaving in a socially
                unacceptable manner or indulging in an illegal activity. In such
                cases no refund will be offered for the unutilised portion of
                the holiday and Skyway tour.com will further claim from you the
                costs of your return to the parent country.

                <strong>13. Arbitration </strong>
                <br />
                If you have cause for complaint during the holiday please bring
                it to the notice of our Representative in India /Agent and/or
                the hotel who will try their best to solve the problem. It is
                not advisable to do nothing about a problem when it occurs but
                to later write to us seeking recompense. If we feel you avoided
                action to redress a problem when it occurred, no compensation
                will be offered if it is brought to our attention later. If the
                problem remains unresolved in spite of your pointing it out
                locally to our agents when it occurred please write to us within
                15 days of the completion of the holiday. We shall come back to
                you after investigation within 15 days with suitable answer or
                compensate you nominally which you need to accept.

                Please be assured that we have measures in place to protect the
                personal booking information held by us. This information will
                be passed on to the relevant suppliers of your travel
                arrangements. The information may also be provided to public
                authorities such as customs or immigration if required by them,
                or as required by law. Certain information may also be passed on
                to security or credit checking companies. Since your travel is
                outside your area, controls on data protection may not be as
                strong as the legal requirements in your country. If we cannot
                pass this information to the relevant suppliers, we will be
                unable to provide your booking. In making this booking, you
                consent to this information being passed on to the relevant
                persons. If we need to give your details to anyone other than
                those listed above we will do so only with your consent.
